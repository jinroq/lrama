  # Digraph Algorithm of https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/69622.357187 (P. 625)
  #
  # Digraph is an algorithm for graph data structure.
  # The algorithm efficiently traverses SCC (Strongly Connected Component) of graph
  # and merges nodes attributes within the same SCC.
  #
  # `compute_read_sets` and `compute_follow_sets` have the same structure.
  # Graph of gotos and attributes of gotos are given then compute propagated attributes for each node.
  #
  # In the case of `compute_read_sets`:
  #
  # * Set of gotos is nodes of graph
  # * `reads_relation` is edges of graph
  # * `direct_read_sets` is nodes attributes
  #
  # In the case of `compute_follow_sets`:
  #
  # * Set of gotos is nodes of graph
  # * `includes_relation` is edges of graph
  # * `read_sets` is nodes attributes
  #

  # @rbs generic Y < _Or    -- Type of attribute sets assigned to a node which should support merge operation (#| method)
